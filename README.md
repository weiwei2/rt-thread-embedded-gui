IIoT Embedded Gui distributed IO with RT-Thread

Industrial IoT distributed IO module. the IO module can connect to different type of sensor and actuator using GPIO and RS485. it can function as a distributed IO using etherNET as well as RS485
"off the shelf distrbuted IO module are faceless whereas this module comes with a resistive touch screen with excellence display of IO status. Rich IO and RS485 enables connectivity to various industrial sensor and actuator. EtherNET interface enables it to function as distributed IO connecting to gateway or Programmable logic controller
